Learning a new language is like embarking on an exciting journey—full of challenges, discoveries, and opportunities. Since moving to Guadalajara, I've realized how essential it is to communicate in Spanish. Whether it’s ordering delicious street food, making new friends, or immersing myself in the vibrant culture, mastering the language opens up a whole new world. But at the beginning, it can feel overwhelming—people speak fast, and cultural norms that seem obvious to locals can be hard to grasp.

This guide explores effective strategies to learn Spanish, with tips applicable to other languages as well. Let’s set sail on this language-learning adventure!

*Life is indeed better with delicious street food*

## Sett your goals
Start with a clear **WHY**  - your reason for learning the language. Understanding your purpose will keep you focussed and motivated.

*My why: Since moving to Guadalajara in August 2024, I want to learn Spanish to connect with people and immerse myself in Mexican culture.*

Next, set **SMART Goals** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

*My SMART goal: I want to feel comfortable speaking Spanish by end of 2024.*

## Choose your resources

There are countless resources available - here is a quick overview:

### Apps:
I started with **Duolingo**, which helped me a lot in the beginning. Although the paid version was helpful for my first year, I now use the free version, as I need different materials. Other options include **Babbel** and **Memrise** (which uses spaced repetition).


### Online Courses:

- [Coursera: Bienvenidos al español: A1.2](https://coursera.org/share/2f947d5e5f928c61840bc260a1d26d51)

### Books, Audiobooks, Movies and Podcasts:
Immerse yourself with media that matches your skill level. Engage actively with the content to pick up on context cues.

#### Books:
I looked for beginner-friendly books and found these child books that might be worth to read:

- [Papelucho](https://www.secst.cl/upfiles/documentos/01082016_941am_579f6daa0a535.pdf)
- [Manolito Gafota](https://www.edu.xunta.gal/centros/ceipbenchosey/system/files/Manolito%20Gafotas%20-%20Elvira%20Lindo.pdf)
- [Cuentos de la Selva](https://web.seducoahuila.gob.mx/biblioweb/upload/Quiroga%20Horacio%20-%20Cuentos%20de%20la%20selva.pdf)

#### Podcasts
I listen to:
- [No Hay Tos](https://www.nohaytospodcast.com/)
- [Chill Spanish Listening Practice](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ4YHlzG7n0R9vXJar69RTA/featured)

## Create a study schedule
Consistency is key. Dedicate 30 minutes to 1 hour daily for focused learning. My current plan includes regular grammar and vocabulary practice, with listening exercises throughout the day from my interactions in Mexico.

## Immerse Yourself

### Think in the target languange
Thinking in the target language helps you internalize vocabulary and grammar. I’ve optimized this with spaced repetition (SRS). I created my own system with flashcards that use images, not translations, to associate words directly with concepts. For grammar practice, I use sentences with blank spaces to insert the correct form. This helps reinforce proper usage naturally.

## Track Progress

### Keep a Journal:
I use a [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) to track my language learning journey. It helps me stay organized and reflect on progress.

### Set Checkpoints:
Evaluate your progress monthly. Check your speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills and adjust your goals as needed.

## Stay positive, stay motivated
Remember your **why** —it’s the main driver of your learning project. Celebrate milestones, no matter how small, and reward yourself when you achieve them. Joining language groups or connecting with other learners can also keep you motivated.

## Conclusion
Learning Spanish is not just about mastering vocabulary and grammar—it's about building connections, exploring a new culture, and feeling at home in your environment. By setting clear goals, choosing the right resources, staying consistent, and celebrating your progress, you can stay on track and make the most of this exciting journey. Stay patient, stay curious, and enjoy the adventure of learning a new language!
