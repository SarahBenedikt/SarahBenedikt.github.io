This quest becomes even more important as we live in anxious times with geopolitical tension, 24/7 connectivity to the internet and jobs with endless pressure and deadline.

*Flow state is a state of mind and body in which you are both productive and happy.*

## Sailing as a physical activity

Like every other physical activity, sailing is good for your mental health. It reduces stress and relieves symptoms of anxiety and depression. It increases your confidence as well as your lifespan.
You will build muscles especially in the arms, hands, core and legs while hoisting and pulling sails. It also improoves your agility, strenght, balance, agility and cardiovascular health. Depending on the wind speed, rough waters or sailing area, sailing can be even more demanding.

## Water and Wind - the elements that makes it all possible?
Water and wind are the key elements for sailing, you can't sail without them but at the same time they also give you huge challenges and let your grow with the years you are surrounded by them. You can find moments of true immersion and mental clarity when you are in full contact with natue.

Being surrounded by water is another triggers a primal sense of safety and security. Some theories think its because water is essential for life and viewing it around you gives you a sense of comfort. When you see the wide horizon in front of you, your eyes get relaxed and your subconsious primal instinct is not fearring the possibility of an ambush because you can't see whats around the next corner.

There are many playlists on spotify about water and / or wind sounds. People use it to relax, fall asleep or for focus. Imagine gentle rolling waves, the sound of the sails then the are hitby the wind and the creaking of the wood when the forces go against the wooden hull and ropes. These are soft, natural sound that our brain categorizes as a non threat. Contrary to Screams or alarm clocks that are abvious threats as they are loud and threatening.  

## Colors and Light

Color is actually a result of light. The light waves are reflected by different surfaces and as a result out eyes see th particular wavelenghts that result in a colour. Thats why most of the oceans are blue but in some places the ocean is blue-green, green, or even yellow to brown.
Blue is many peoples favourite color. It's categorized as a non threatening color that brings out feelings of piece and tranquility but its also considered as traditional and reliable.

Sunlight is a natural source of Vitmin D. Thats why you felt much better after some hours outside in the sun. There are many health benefits for Vitamin D. Just to name a few : fighting deseases such as heart desease, support the immune system, regulate your mood, reduce the risk of depression.

## Awareness and life in the moment
To be out in the nature with a sailing boat, you need a full awareness of the elemnts around you and the boat. Wind and weather conditions are changing contantly and they keep you tootet in the here and now which enhances overall mindfulness. 

## What is the flow state?
Flow occurs when there is a perfect balance between the challenge at hand and your ability to meet it, creating a state of focused immersion and optimal performance.

*Perfect balance between challange and skill*

The major characteristics of the flow state are:

1) intense focus and concentration on the present moment
2)loss of reflective self-consciousness - you are focussed on what needs to be done in the moment
3) distortion of temporal experience (the time slows down)
4) experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding 


## How do I get into a flow state?

The answer is simple, practise, practise, practise. You should build a skillset ad find the right level of challenge for our skills.
At the beginning this might be hard, I had a lot of students that are nervous and scared on their first time on the boat. Only training will give you ne needed skills and build up your self confidence. Thats do far the straigth forward part, the diffiult part is to get your brain and mind ready for the skills / challenge. that requires you to deal with your own psychological "package". It may require introspection, mindfulness, meditation or yoga to deal with anxiety, perfectionism or attention deficite. All these parameters can block you from being the flow state so its important to address them. 

## Conclusion
From a realistic point of view, getting into the flow state is a worthy goal in life, however what is probably more important is to understand the process and what is holding you back. In todays times sociel media will be most probably your most worthy opponent. Sailing is a great way to increse your overall mental health and getting a bit closer to mental clarity and the flow state. What more could we ask for?

May the flow be with you.
